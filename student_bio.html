	<p>Hello all!</p>
	<p>I am Tiara Hamilton; call me Tia! I am a 26 year old ex-military brat (Airforce branch). I grew up in Germany for the first six years of my life. I have also been to Stockholm, Sweden, Nagoya, Japan, and all over the U.S. So I will be adding Toronto, Ontario, Canada to my list.</p>

<p>I starting getting into coding when I was given an internship at an anime website called <a href="http://www.animenewsnetwork.com" target="_blank">Anime News Network</a>. After that, I began messing around with the coding for blog layouts. It was then that I realized, I really enjoyed coding. Even when it angers me to no end.</p>
